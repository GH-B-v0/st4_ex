# st4_ex
Sublime Text v4 plugins system extension

this is a simple st4 plugin with a sole purpose:
whenever a new view is created by user, this plugin will set its syntaxt to the pre-configured syntax, automatically.

by default, the new view syntax has been set for Python.
to change it just change the relative path to the desired language / syntax file within the 'new_view_syntaxer.py' file.
